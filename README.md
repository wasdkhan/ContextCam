# ContextCam
ContextCam is a project from [HackPrinceton](hackprinceton.com) Spring 2017. ContextCam runs on the Raspberry PI with a RPi Cameram, a single push button, and a mobile power source. It takes a picture, runs it through Watson and Indico to get context about the image. Then, through use of nltk and PyDictionary, it generates a description about the image and outputs as audio.

The positioning of the object is important, preferably in the center with a monochromatic background for better results. It currently takes top three predictions and forms a description with them. For emotional analysis, it gets the top three emotions and describes the person.
